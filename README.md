Download and unzip contents from https://github.com/SanaeEsskhayry/AMR-Prediction-in-Chlamydia-strains.git

# Generating the PKL file
The machine learning model used in this web app will first have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter Notebook amr_prediction_model.ipynb. Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickled model called amr_predict_model.pkl will be generated.

# Rebuilding this web app
To recreate this web app on your own computer, do the following.
## Create conda environment
Firstly, we will create a conda environment called AMRPapp
```bash
conda create -n AMRPapp
```

## Change directory to the AMR-Prediction-in-Chlamydia-strains
Navigate to the directory where the project is located
```bash
cd path/to/AMR-Prediction-in-Chlamydia-strains/directory
```

## Secondly, activate the AMRPapp environment 
```bash
conda activate AMRPapp
```

## Install prerequisite libraries
Download requirements.txt file
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanaeEsskhayry/AMR-Prediction-in-Chlamydia-strains/master/requirements.txt
```
Pip install libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launch the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
